    <h1> 1. Asset Register </h1><br>
        <p> A simple and effective system that keeps record of all assets we have in the school. The system has its proceses and proceedures in updating records, ensuring assets records are in order aged assets are disposed properly. But more importantly, budgets on asstes are controlled and properly managed so we dont purchase duplicate items.<br><br>

            <h1> 2. Students Assessment System </h1><br>
            
            <p>The Student Assessment System has been a cornerstone of our school since 2017. We have continually invested in enhancing our academic assessment processes, which have led to significant improvements benefiting the system's users. Manual errors have been minimized, teachers now experience a more streamlined process by simply entering raw marks, parents receive their children's reports on time, and the report cards feature in-depth academic analysis.
            <p>In 2022, we redesigned the system to align with SBC standards while simultaneously enhancing the user experience to make the system more user-friendly and effective. The Student Assessment System is continuously undergoing improvements to provide the best possible user experience and deliver high-quality academic analytical reports.</p>

            <h1> 3. TFF Aquital System </h1><br>
            
            <p>Weâ€™ve developed an in-house Aquital System that manages all our financial earnings and expenditures, which are reflected in the periodic Aquital Report that is readily available for issuance. The system is designed to capture data entries, while it handles all calculations, analysis, and reporting automatically. This system has saved a significant amount of man-hours and reduced the stress associated with calculations and reconciliation, while also providing the best reporting analysis in compliance with auditing requirements.<br><br>
            We are still improving the system by comparing it to other systems to achieve the best possible outcomes and effective reporting.</p>
